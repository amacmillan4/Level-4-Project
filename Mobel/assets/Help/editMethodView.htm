<h3>Editing a Method</h3>

<P>Tap any of the fields and a keyboard will appear so that you can make changes; touch and hold to position the cursor.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Restore</B> to restore the original values for all the fields.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Save</B> to save your changes and return to the methods screen.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Cancel</B> to return to the methods screen without saving 
your changes.</P>

<P>The <B>Method Name</B> should not include the method type (eg, Surprise) or Stage (eg, Minor).</P>

<P>The <B>Short Name</B> can be up to three characters; Mobel uses it 
only on the Settings screen, to list the methods in a 
Touch of Spliced.</P>

<P><B>Place Notation</B>.  Mobel accepts most common forms of 
place notation.  For example, Plain Bob Minor can be specified as:

<UL>
<LI>x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 12</LI>
<LI>x1x1x1x1x1x2</LI>
<LI>&amp;-1-1-1+2</LI>
<LI>a &amp;x1x1x1</LI>
</UL>

Contiguous places can be separated by a dot or a space.</P>

<P>For <B>Bobs</B> and <B>Singles</B> you specify the place notation, how often the call can occur, and the row within a lead where the call first occurs (1 is the first row, 2 the 2nd, and 0 is shorthand for the last row).</P>
