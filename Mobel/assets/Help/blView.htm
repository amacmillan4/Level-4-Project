<h3>What You See:</h3>

<P>Mobel shows a tradional "blue line diagram" for a method, 
in one of three styles: <B>rows</B>, <B>frame</B> and <B>grid</b>.</P>

<P> In <B>rows</B> style, Mobels shows the rows (bell numbers) for a 
plain course of the method.</P>

<P>In <B>rows</B> and <B>frame</B> styles, Mobel shows
a red line for up to two hunt bells.  It shows a blue line for a working bell
(and a green one for handbells), usually for the bell(s) you have 
selected to ring (ie, at the bottom of Mobel's main screen).  
If the bell(s) you have selected are hunt bells, Mobel shows working bell
line(s) for the tenor(s) instead.</P>

<P> In <B>grid</B> style, Mobel shows a single lead of the method,
with up to two red lines for hunting trebles, and blue lines for
all the other bells.</P>

<P>If calls are defined for the method, Mobel shows diagrams for those too, 
with red lines for any hunting treble(s), 
and blue lines for all the other bells.</P>

<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap a bell on Mobel's main screen, to select it for ringing and
move it to 
bottom right of the circle; its line is then shown on the blue line display
in <B>rows</B> and <B>frame</B> styles.</P>

<P>Use pinch gestures on the blue line display to increase/decrease 
the size of the diagram.</P>

<P>Drag the diagram left and right to view parts that are off the edge 
of the screen.</P>

<P>Double tap the blue line display to change the style.<P>

<P>Mobel remembers the current style and size 
for each stage (number of bells).</P>
