<h3>The Compositions Are:</h3>

<P><B>Plain Course</B>.  A plain course of any method.  You can insert bobs and/or singles yourself, by tapping the top of the screen during the ringing.  Tap top left for bobs, top right for singles.</P>

<P><B>Touch with Bobs and/or Singles</B>.  Mobel will call bobs and/or singles during the ringing of a single method: about one call in every three leads.</P>

<P>The Touches are different each time you start the bells. They are not necessarily true (ie, some changes may be repeated), and do not necessarily come back to rounds.</P>

<P>If you select a Plain Course or Touch with Bobs and/or Singles, you can then select the method to be rung by tapping <B>Method</B> on the Settings screen.  If you select a Touch of Spliced, tap <B>Method</B> to select up to 100 methods from the method list.</P>
