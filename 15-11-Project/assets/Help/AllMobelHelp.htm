<h2>Main View</h2>

<h3>When the Bells Are Not Ringing:</h3>

<P>Tap a bell to move it to the bottom right of the circle, 
so you can ring it (see below).</P>

<P>Tap <B>Start</B> to start the bells ringing (see below).</P>

<P>Tap <B>Show</B> to see the blue line for the current method(s).
If the current composition is Touch of Spliced, you'll see the current
list of methods for the composition: tap a blue button to see the blue line 
for a method.  The <B>Help</B> button on the blue line screen gives 
further details: essentially, you can pinch to zoom, and double tap to 
change style.</P>

<P>Tap 
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4> <B><i>i</i></B> </FONT>
to view and change method(s), composition, ringing speed, etc, 
and to see the blue line for other methods.  The <B>Help</B> button
on the Settings screen gives further details.</P>

<P>Drag the centre of the circle to move it to the other end of the display.</P>

<h3>When the Bells Are Ringing:</h3>

<P>With tower bells, tap the bottom of the screen 
to ring the bell at bottom right of the bell circle. 
It rings immediately you tap.  If "Score Blows" is
turned on in Settings, a score (0..10) appears to show the 
accuracy of your striking for each blow.</P>

<P>With hand bells, tap the bottom right of the screen 
to ring the bell at bottom right of the bell circle, 
and tap the bottom left of the screen to ring the bell at bottom left 
of the circle. If "Score Blows" is
turned on in Settings, a score (0..10) appears to show the 
accuracy of your striking for that blow. </P>

<P>When you start ringing a bell, Mobel will not ring it any more.  
But if you stop ringing, Mobel will ring it again after a few blows.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Go</B> to "go next time".  (Mobel will say "Go <i>methodName</i>" for 
common methods, and "Go next time" for others; the method name always
appears on screen.)
When a method is going, tap <B>Rounds</B> to call rounds at the next handstroke.</P>

<P>To conduct, tap the top left of the bell circle 
to call a bob at the next lead end (if bobs are defined for the method).  
Tap the top right of the bell circle to call a single 
(if singles are defined).  Tap again to cancel a call.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Pause</B> to pause the ringing.  
Then you can tap <B>Continue</B> to resume it.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Stand</B> to call stand at the next handstroke.  
Then you can tap <B>Stop</B> if you want to stop immediately.
If "Score Summary" is turned on in Settings, a score appears 
by the bell(s) you have rung, to show the overall
accuracy of your striking. </P>

<P>Tap 
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4> <B><i>i</i></B> </FONT>
to view and change settings.  
This will pause the ringing, and will abandon the current touch 
if you change the current composition or any method.</P>


<h2>Blue Line View</h2>
<h3>What You See:</h3>

<P>Mobel shows a tradional "blue line diagram" for a method, 
in one of three styles: <B>rows</B>, <B>frame</B> and <B>grid</b>.</P>

<P> In <B>rows</B> style, Mobels shows the rows (bell numbers) for a 
plain course of the method.</P>

<P>In <B>rows</B> and <B>frame</B> styles, Mobel shows
a red line for up to two hunt bells.  It shows a blue line for a working bell
(and a green one for handbells), usually for the bell(s) you have 
selected to ring (ie, at the bottom of Mobel's main screen).  
If the bell(s) you have selected are hunt bells, Mobel shows working bell
line(s) for the tenor(s) instead.</P>

<P> In <B>grid</B> style, Mobel shows a single lead of the method,
with up to two red lines for hunting trebles, and blue lines for
all the other bells.</P>

<P>If calls are defined for the method, Mobel shows diagrams for those too, 
with red lines for any hunting treble(s), 
and blue lines for all the other bells.</P>

<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap a bell on Mobel's main screen, to select it for ringing and
move it to 
bottom right of the circle; its line is then shown on the blue line display
in <B>rows</B> and <B>frame</B> styles.</P>

<P>Use pinch gestures on the blue line display to increase/decrease 
the size of the diagram.</P>

<P>Drag the diagram left and right to view parts that are off the edge 
of the screen.</P>

<P>Double tap the blue line display to change the style.<P>

<P>Mobel remembers the current style and size 
for each stage (number of bells).</P>


<h2>Settings View</h2>
<h3>Settings You Can Change Are:</h3>

<P>Method <B>Stage</B> (the number of bells in a method).  
Tap <B>Stage</B>, then tap the number of bells you want to ring.  
Odd-bell stages automatically add a tenor behind, except for Doubles 
where the tenor is optional.  </P>

<P><B>Composition</B>.  Tap <B>Composition</B> to select a different composition for 
Mobel to ring.  The <B>Help</B> button on the Compositions screen gives further details.</P>

<P><B>Method</B>.  Tap <B>Method</B> to select different method(s) to ring
for the current Stage and Composition (see above),
view the blue line diagram for methods, 
and add, edit and delete methods.  
The <B>Help</B> button on the Method screen gives further details.</P>

<P><B>Bell Type</B>:  
<UL>
<LI>If you tap <B>Tower Bells</B>, Mobel uses sally/tail pictures, tower bell sounds, 
ringing speeds appropriate to tower bells (unless you change them!), and lets you ring 
the bell at bottom right of the bell circle on the main screen</LI>
<LI>If you tap <B>Hand Bells</B>, Mobel uses handbell pictures and sounds, 
speeds appropriate to handbell ringing, and lets you ring the pair of bells at 
the bottom of the bell circle on the main screen.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Ringing Speed</B>.  Tap <B>Peal Time</B>, then set the time on the picker wheel.  
The <B>Help</B> button on the Peal Time screen gives further details.</P>

<P><B>Stop at Rounds</B>.  If you turn this switch on, 
Mobel will call "That's All" when rounds occur during ringing, 
and will call "Stand" two blows later.  If you turn the switch off, 
Mobel will just carry on when rounds occur.</P>

<P><B>Handstroke Gap</B>.  If you turn this switch on, Mobel will ring with 
a one-bell handstroke gap.  If you turn the switch off, Mobel will ring "cartwheeling".</P>

<P><B>Wait for Me</B>.  If you turn this switch on, then hesitate when ringing a bell, 
Mobel will wait for you to ring it.  If you turn the switch off, 
Mobel will carry on ringing its own bells at the right time, 
even if you hesitate when ringing yours.</P>

<P><B>Score Blows</B>.  If you turn this switch on, when you ring a bell a score
(0..10) appears beside it to show the accuracy of your striking for that blow.</P>

<P><B>Score Summary</B>.  If you turn this switch on, when you stand the bells
a score (0..10) appears beside the bell(s) you have rung, to show the overall
accuracy of your striking.</P>

<P><B>Orientation Lock</B>.  If you turn this switch on, Mobel ignores changes 
of device orientation while the bells are ringing.  Mobel always responds to 
orientation changes between portrait and landscape when the bells are not ringing.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Done</b> on the Settings screen to ensure any changes are saved and 
return to the main screen.</P>


<h2>Compositions View</h2>
<h3>The Compositions Are:</h3>

<P><B>Plain Course</B>.  A plain course of any method.  You can insert bobs and/or singles yourself, by tapping the top of the screen during the ringing.  Tap top left for bobs, top right for singles.</P>

<P><B>Touch with Bobs and/or Singles</B>.  Mobel will call bobs and/or singles during the ringing of a single method: about one call in every three leads.</P>

<P><B>Touch of Spliced</B>.  Mobel will call method changes and bobs during the ringing.  At a method change, Mobel will say the method name 
for common methods, and "Change method" for others; the method name 
always appears on screen.</P>

<P>The Touches are different each time you start the bells. They are not necessarily true (ie, some changes may be repeated), and do not necessarily come back to rounds.</P>

<P>If you select a Plain Course or Touch with Bobs and/or Singles, you can then select the method to be rung by tapping <B>Method</B> on the Settings screen.  If you select a Touch of Spliced, tap <B>Method</B> to select up to 100 methods from the method list.</P>


<h2>Methods View</h2>
<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap a blue button to see the blue line for a method.</P>

<P>If the current composition is Plain Course or Touch with Bobs 
and/or Singles, tap a method you want to ring, replacing the 
previously selected (ticked) method for all these compositions.</P>

<P>If the current composition is Touch of Spliced, 
tap any method that is not selected (not ticked) to add it to the composition; 
tap any method that is already selected (ticked) 
to remove it from the composition.  The 's' beside the ticks is
to remind you this is a spliced composition. To remove all methods from 
the composition, tap <B>Deselect All</B>.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Add</B> to add a new method for the current method stage, 
then tap the method type you want.  
The <B>Help</B> button on the following screen gives further details.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Edit</B> if you want to change the details of a method, 
then tap the method you want to change (or tap <B>Cancel</B>).  
The <B>Help</B> button on the Edit Method screen gives further details.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Delete</B> to delete one or more methods.  
For each method you want to delete, tap the button beside the method then confirm by tapping the red Delete button that appears (or tap elsewhere to cancel).  When you've finished deleting methods, tap the <B>Cancel</B> button.  You can also delete a single method by swiping it then tapping the red Delete button to confirm.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Settings</B> when you want to return to the Settings screen.</P>


<h2>Add Method View</h2>
<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap any method that is not selected, to select (tick) it.</P>

<P>Tap any method that is already selected (ticked), to deselect it.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Deselect All</B> to deselect all the methods 
you have selected.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Save</B> to save any methods you have selected 
and return to the methods screen.  After this, you may want 
to tap <B>Edit</B>, to change details of the method(s), as explained
below. </P>

<P>Tap <B>Cancel</B> to return to the methods screen without
saving any methods you have selected.</P>

<h3>What Mobel Does:</h3>

<P>Mobel gets methods from the microSIRIL library, which contains 
more than 15,000 methods and is included in the Mobel download.</P>

<P>The microSIRIL library gives the names of methods without any spaces
or capitalisation.  After you've added a method you may want to Edit it
to put spaces and capitalisation into a name (but Mobel does it
automatically for plain methods that end in Bob, Place or Slow Course).</P>

<P>Mobel adds a <B>Short Name</B> for a method, which it uses on the Settings
screen to show the list of methods in a Touch of Spliced.  
It uses the first
three characters of the method name.  
After you've added a method you may want to Edit it to 
change the Short Name to something more meaningful to you.</P>

<P>The microSIRIL library gives the place notation for methods,
but does not give any calls (bobs and singles).
For single hunt and twin hunt methods, Mobel takes a guess at what bobs 
and singles you want - and it is usually right!  
Note that it doesn't do this for Principles; 
and that for Doubles methods it follows Central Council rules - which 
are sometimes different from the calls given in the "red book" Diagrams.  
Thus when you've added a method, you may want Edit it, 
to add calls for a Principle, change the calls to match Diagrams 
or local convention in your tower, or specify a Doubles variation.</P>


<h2>Edit Method View</h2>
<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap any of the fields and a keyboard will appear so that you can make changes; touch and hold to position the cursor.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Restore</B> to restore the original values for all the fields.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Save</B> to save your changes and return to the methods screen.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Cancel</B> to return to the methods screen without saving 
your changes.</P>

<P>The <B>Method Name</B> should not include the method type (eg, Surprise) or Stage (eg, Minor).</P>

<P>The <B>Short Name</B> can be up to three characters; Mobel uses it 
only on the Settings screen, to list the methods in a 
Touch of Spliced.</P>

<P><B>Place Notation</B>.  Mobel accepts most common forms of 
place notation.  For example, Plain Bob Minor can be specified as:

<UL>
<LI>x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 x 12</LI>
<LI>x1x1x1x1x1x2</LI>
<LI>&amp;-1-1-1+2</LI>
<LI>a &amp;x1x1x1</LI>
</UL>

Contiguous places can be separated by a dot or a space.</P>

<P>For <B>Bobs</B> and <B>Singles</B> you specify the place notation, how often the call can occur, and the row within a lead where the call first occurs (1 is the first row, 2 the 2nd, and 0 is shorthand for the last row).</P>


<h2>Peal Time View</h2>
<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>You set the speed that Mobel rings by setting the peal time, typically between 1 hour 40 for six handbells rung quickly and 4 hours for 16 tower bells rung  slowly.</P>

<P>You can set different peal times for each number of bells, from 4 to 16, and also different times for tower bells and handbells.</P>

<P>Setting the time on the picker wheel sets the peal time for the current number of bells (Stage) and bell type, as specified on the Settings screen.</P>

<P>Due to device limitations, at some speeds the ringing rhythm is not absolutely steady.  
(It's unsteady if the inter-bell gap is a submultiple of 1.50 to 1.54 seconds.)  
If you notice that the rhythm is unsteady, change the ringing speed slightly.</P>

<P>When you've made any changes, tap <B>Settings</b> to return to the Settings screen.</P>
