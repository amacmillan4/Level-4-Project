Mobel will just carry on when rounds occur.</P>

a one-bell handstroke gap.  If you turn the switch off, Mobel will ring "cartwheeling".</P>

<P><B>Wait for Me</B>.  If you turn this switch on, then hesitate when ringing a bell, 
Mobel will wait for you to ring it.  If you turn the switch off, 
Mobel will carry on ringing its own bells at the right time, 
even if you hesitate when ringing yours.</P>

<P><B>Score Blows</B>.  If you turn this switch on, when you ring a bell a score
(0..10) appears beside it to show the accuracy of your striking for that blow.</P>

a score (0..10) appears beside the bell(s) you have rung, to show the overall
accuracy of your striking.</P>

of device orientation while the bells are ringing.  Mobel always responds to 
orientation changes between portrait and landscape when the bells are not ringing.</P>
