<h3>When the Bells Are Not Ringing:</h3>

<P>Tap a bell to move it to the bottom right of the circle, 
so you can ring it (see below).</P>

<P>Tap <B>Start</B> to start the bells ringing (see below).</P>

<P>Tap <B>Show</B> to see the blue line for the current method(s).
If the current composition is Touch of Spliced, you'll see the current
list of methods for the composition: tap a blue button to see the blue line 
for a method.  The <B>Help</B> button on the blue line screen gives 
further details: essentially, you can pinch to zoom, and double tap to 
change style.</P>

<P>Tap 
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4> <B><i>i</i></B> </FONT>
to view and change method(s), composition, ringing speed, etc, 
and to see the blue line for other methods.  The <B>Help</B> button
on the Settings screen gives further details.</P>

<P>Drag the centre of the circle to move it to the other end of the display.</P>

<h3>When the Bells Are Ringing:</h3>

<P>With tower bells, tap the bottom of the screen 
to ring the bell at bottom right of the bell circle. 
It rings immediately you tap.  If "Score Blows" is
turned on in Settings, a score (0..10) appears to show the 
accuracy of your striking for each blow.</P>

<P>With hand bells, tap the bottom right of the screen 
to ring the bell at bottom right of the bell circle, 
and tap the bottom left of the screen to ring the bell at bottom left 
of the circle. If "Score Blows" is
turned on in Settings, a score (0..10) appears to show the 
accuracy of your striking for that blow. </P>

<P>When you start ringing a bell, Mobel will not ring it any more.  
But if you stop ringing, Mobel will ring it again after a few blows.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Go</B> to "go next time".  (Mobel will say "Go <i>methodName</i>" for 
common methods, and "Go next time" for others; the method name always
appears on screen.)
When a method is going, tap <B>Rounds</B> to call rounds at the next handstroke.</P>

<P>To conduct, tap the top left of the bell circle 
to call a bob at the next lead end (if bobs are defined for the method).  
Tap the top right of the bell circle to call a single 
(if singles are defined).  Tap again to cancel a call.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Pause</B> to pause the ringing.  
Then you can tap <B>Continue</B> to resume it.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Stand</B> to call stand at the next handstroke.  
Then you can tap <B>Stop</B> if you want to stop immediately.
If "Score Summary" is turned on in Settings, a score appears 
by the bell(s) you have rung, to show the overall
accuracy of your striking. </P>

<P>Tap 
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=4> <B><i>i</i></B> </FONT>
to view and change settings.  
This will pause the ringing, and will abandon the current touch 
if you change the current composition or any method.</P>
