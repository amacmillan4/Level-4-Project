<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>

<P>Tap any method that is not selected, to select (tick) it.</P>

<P>Tap any method that is already selected (ticked), to deselect it.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Deselect All</B> to deselect all the methods 
you have selected.</P>

<P>Tap <B>Save</B> to save any methods you have selected 
and return to the methods screen.  After this, you may want 
to tap <B>Edit</B>, to change details of the method(s), as explained
below. </P>

<P>Tap <B>Cancel</B> to return to the methods screen without
saving any methods you have selected.</P>

<h3>What Mobel Does:</h3>

<P>Mobel gets methods from the microSIRIL library, which contains 
more than 15,000 methods and is included in the Mobel download.</P>

<P>The microSIRIL library gives the names of methods without any spaces
or capitalisation.  After you've added a method you may want to Edit it
to put spaces and capitalisation into a name (but Mobel does it
automatically for plain methods that end in Bob, Place or Slow Course).</P>

<P>Mobel adds a <B>Short Name</B> for a method, which it uses on the Settings
screen to show the list of methods in a Touch of Spliced.  
It uses the first
three characters of the method name.  
After you've added a method you may want to Edit it to 
change the Short Name to something more meaningful to you.</P>

<P>The microSIRIL library gives the place notation for methods,
but does not give any calls (bobs and singles).
For single hunt and twin hunt methods, Mobel takes a guess at what bobs 
and singles you want - and it is usually right!  
Note that it doesn't do this for Principles; 
and that for Doubles methods it follows Central Council rules - which 
are sometimes different from the calls given in the "red book" Diagrams.  
Thus when you've added a method, you may want Edit it, 
to add calls for a Principle, change the calls to match Diagrams 
or local convention in your tower, or specify a Doubles variation.</P>
