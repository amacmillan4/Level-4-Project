<h3>Setting Peal Times</h3>

<P>You set the speed that Mobel rings by setting the peal time, typically between 1 hour 40 for six handbells rung quickly and 4 hours for 16 tower bells rung  slowly.</P>

<P>You can set different peal times for each number of bells, from 4 to 16, and also different times for tower bells and handbells.</P>

<P>Setting the time on the picker wheel sets the peal time for the current number of bells (Stage) and bell type, as specified on the Settings screen.</P>

<P>Due to device limitations, at some speeds the ringing rhythm is not absolutely steady.  
(It's unsteady if the inter-bell gap is a submultiple of 1.50 to 1.54 seconds.)  
If you notice that the rhythm is unsteady, change the ringing speed slightly.</P>

<P>When you've made any changes, tap <B>Settings</b> to return to the Settings screen.</P>
