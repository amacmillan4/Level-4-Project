Using the current algorithm and ciphertext, it requires 4 blocks to unambigously decode the message.

Key = 0x719B
Decoded Text = I have n
All Text = I have never let my schooling interfere with my education

K = 16^4 = 65536
H(K) = log2(K) = 16

2 Hex characters per letter so alphabet size R = 16 ^ 2 = 2 ^ 8 = 8 bits
r = [1.0,1.5] so larger value is taken = 1.5

Unicity Distance = 16/(8 - 1.5) = 2.46 Characters 
Therefore 3 Characters are needed in an optimal solution

2 Characters per block, therefore only 2 blocks are needed
